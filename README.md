# :triangular_flag_on_post: svelte-sample

This is sample project with svelte.

## :rocket: Get started

Run below commands.

```bash
pnpm install

node --run dev
```

## Caution

Almost of all lInt & formatter are used Biome.
But, Biome is not completely adopted to svelte.
So, I use prettier with html formatting.
